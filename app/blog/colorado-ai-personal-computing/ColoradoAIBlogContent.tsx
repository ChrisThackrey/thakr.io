      <h2>The Wall That Wasn't</h2>
      <p>
        In early 2025, a common refrain echoed through tech circles: "We're hitting a wall in AI." Just weeks later,
        that narrative crumbled when DeepSeek, a Chinese AI company, released its revolutionary R1 model. This
        innovation sent shockwaves through the industry, even causing market valuations to drop by $1 trillion in
        aggregate as investors reassessed the competitive landscape.
      </p>
      <p>
        "We haven't even started engineering yet," was the incredulous response from Colorado's vibrant AI community to
        those who had prematurely declared AI's slowdown. DeepSeek's breakthrough—particularly its GRUPO training method
        that dramatically improves efficiency—demonstrated that innovation was accelerating rather than stalling.
      </p>
      <p>
        While Silicon Valley often dominates AI headlines, something remarkable is happening in the shadow of the Rocky
        Mountains. Colorado has quietly become a powerhouse of AI innovation, particularly in practical, accessible
        applications that are shifting AI from centralized cloud services to personal devices and custom
        microapplications.
      </p>
      <p>
        This evolution represents a fundamental paradigm shift—from what one local engineer calls "mainframe thinking"
        to a distributed approach that puts AI's power directly in users' hands. And Colorado's thriving AI ecosystem is
        helping lead the way.
      </p>

      <h2>Colorado's Thriving AI Ecosystem</h2>
      <p>
        The Rocky Mountain High Interest Group (RMHIG) exemplifies Colorado's burgeoning AI community. Their recent
        event at CU Boulder sold out in just three days, with 150 attendees and another 90 on the waiting list. "It was
        crazy. It was nuts," describes one organizer. "People were crouching in the aisles."
      </p>
      <p>
        What makes this community special isn't just its size but its composition. At the CU Boulder event,
        approximately 60% of attendees were engineers—people "rolling up their sleeves and doing stuff," not just
        talking about theoretical possibilities. This practical, hands-on approach characterizes Colorado's AI scene.
      </p>
      <p>
        The community has rapidly expanded to include 11-12 specialized subgroups focusing on engineering, ethics (led
        by Robert Monaco), education (led by Bobby Hodgkinson), startups, product development, and geographic regions
        like Denver. Each subgroup addresses specific interests while maintaining connections to the broader ecosystem.
      </p>
      <p>
        "I've been so impressed with how the Boulder, Denver, Colorado AI community is just continuing to compound on
        itself," notes one participant. "Everybody talks about how hot San Francisco is, but I would argue it's easy to
        jump into Colorado and get plugged into high-quality engineers and entrepreneurs very quickly."
      </p>
      <p>
        Local companies are seeing significant success, too. Cameo, a Colorado AI company, announced an $11 million
        funding round immediately following an RMHIG talk. Meanwhile, hiring at Google's Boulder campus has accelerated,
        with AI-focused roles leading the way.
      </p>
      <p>
        The community continues to grow with upcoming events like Ryan's builders meetup in Boulder and a tech and
        design meetup scheduled for Green Spaces in downtown Denver. These gatherings further strengthen the network of
        AI practitioners in the region.
      </p>

      <h2>The Technical Revolution Enabling Personal AI</h2>

      <BlogImage

        alt="Personal AI computing on a laptop device"
        caption="Personal AI applications are shifting computing from cloud services to local devices"
        className="my-10"
      />

      <p>
        The podcast participants expressed particular excitement about DeepSeek's innovations, especially the GRUPO
        (Generative Representation Using Preference Optimization) method that makes training large language models more
        efficient.
      </p>
      <p>
        "When DPO came out, direct preference optimization, that's a way to fine-tune large language models very
        straightforwardly," explains one speaker. Previous methods like PPO (Proximal Policy Optimization) required
        complex setups with multiple competing models. DPO simplified this to just "a few examples of data and one tutor
        model." Now, GRUPO takes that efficiency even further.
      </p>
      <p>
        This progression—PPO to DPO to GRUPO in just a couple of years—demonstrates how rapidly the field is advancing,
        making capable AI more accessible to developers outside major tech companies. In practical terms, this means
        businesses can now train specialized models for their specific needs with significantly less data and computing
        resources.
      </p>
      <p>
        Equally important is the hardware evolution, particularly the competition between traditional powerhouse Nvidia
        and Apple's increasingly capable Silicon chips. The participants note that Apple Silicon can run inference
        operations at "50-60 times less energy draw" than comparable Nvidia setups, addressing critical power and
        cooling challenges.
      </p>
      <p>
        One speaker traces this advantage back to fundamental architectural choices: "The whole thing about M1 silicon
        is they're using ARM chips. Arms are the revenge of reduced instruction set computing." While Nvidia followed
        Intel's complex instruction approach that prioritized developer convenience over efficiency, Apple optimized for
        power constraints.
      </p>
      <p>
        The result? Even consumer-grade MacBooks can now run substantial AI models locally. While the full 67B-parameter
        DeepSeek R1 model might require "a stack of Mac Studios or Mac minis," distilled versions running 7-14B
        parameters perform remarkably well on standard laptops. This enables capabilities like generating code,
        analyzing data, and creating content completely offline and privately.
      </p>

      <h2>The Rise of DIY AI and Microapplications</h2>
      <p>
        Tools like LM Studio have dramatically simplified the process of running local AI models. "We've been saying for
        a while that you need to go get your hands dirty," notes one participant. "When we first started 7 or 8 months
        ago, I could still maybe see someone say, 'it's still a little too hard for me.' That's over."
      </p>
      <p>
        Today's tools allow even those with limited technical expertise to download and experiment with powerful models.
        With just a few clicks, users can install LM Studio, download models from Hugging Face, and start interacting
        with AI that runs entirely on their own device—no cloud services required.
      </p>
      <p>
        "The way I think about it for laypeople or just the general entrepreneur is that I think this is the year of
        very affordable microapplications that are very personal and tuned to me," explains one speaker. "In the past
        week and a half, I've probably built ten apps that do very specific things for me, using B0 that just in a
        series of 10 to 15 prompts, I've got full stack web apps that now do exactly what I need them to."
      </p>
      <p>
        This shift from centralized to distributed AI represents a fundamental philosophical change: "Let's get away
        from mainframe thinking. Let's think how we can break problems into small pieces and deploy the small pieces
        that we understand, as opposed to delegating it to a giant out in the cloud to do everything."
      </p>
      <p>
        The podcast participants compare the current moment to the early days of electricity. "It reminds me of what it
        must have been like when they harnessed generating electricity, and then everyone was like, 'well, what are we
        going to plug in?'" While the technology has been developed, we're just beginning to discover its applications.
      </p>
      <p>
        This experimentation is leading to personalized AI tools for specific needs rather than one-size-fits-all cloud
        solutions. Examples include personal data analyzers that work with your specific datasets, custom creative
        assistants tuned to your writing style, and productivity tools that understand your workflow.
      </p>
      <p>
        "Just because you think that these things are going to take over your job, you're still going to have things to
        do," reassures one speaker, addressing concerns about AI replacing human workers. "Every one of these tools,
        people have come along and said, 'this is going to replace you.' And it more and more seems like that just isn't
        how technology ever works."
      </p>

      <h2>Golden Age or Dark Age?</h2>
      <p>
        As one participant poignantly observes: "I can't decide if we're in a golden age of development or the beginning
        of the dark age. But I love it."
      </p>
      <p>
        Colorado's AI community embodies this balance of excitement and thoughtfulness—embracing new capabilities while
        considering their implications. The shift from centralized to personal AI represents not just a technical
        evolution but a philosophical one, empowering individuals and small teams rather than consolidating capabilities
        in a few large companies.
      </p>
      <p>
        For developers, entrepreneurs, and technology enthusiasts, the message is clear: download tools like LM Studio,
        experiment with locally running models, and start building applications that solve specific problems. The
        technical barriers have fallen dramatically, opening opportunities for innovation beyond what even the experts
        have imagined.
      </p>
      <p>
        As AI continues evolving through 2025 and beyond, the Colorado community's practical, hands-on approach offers a
        model for how to democratize these powerful technologies. The future of AI isn't just in massive data centers
        but in the personal devices and custom applications that put cutting-edge capabilities directly in users' hands.
