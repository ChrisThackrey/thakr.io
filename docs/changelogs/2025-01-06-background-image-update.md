# Changelog: Background Image Update

## Date: 2025-01-06

## Summary
Updated the PageBackground component to use the correct background image (`light-background.png`) as requested and ensured it's consistently applied across all pages.

## Changes Made

### 1. Updated Background Image Path
- **File**: `components/page-background.tsx`
- **Change**: Updated line 28 from `/images/light-background-01.jpg` to `/images/light-background.png`
- **Details**: The component now uses the correct light-background.png image file that exists in the public/images directory

### 2. Added PageBackground to Missing Pages
Added the PageBackground component to pages that were missing it:

- **app/blog/page.tsx**: 
  - Added PageBackground import
  - Added `<PageBackground />` component after the BlogErrorBoundary wrapper
  
- **app/work/page.tsx**:
  - Added PageBackground import
  - Added `<PageBackground />` component in the main container
  
- **app/about/page.tsx**:
  - Added PageBackground import
  - Added `<PageBackground />` component wrapped in a React Fragment for the reduced motion return statement

### 3. Verified Existing Usage
Confirmed that PageBackground was already properly implemented in:
- `app/page.tsx` (homepage)
- `app/projects/page.tsx`
- `app/blog/[slug]/page.tsx` (individual blog posts)
- `app/architecture/page.tsx`
- `app/booking/page.tsx`
- `app/settings/custom-actions/page.tsx`
- `app/work/WorkPageClient.tsx`

## Technical Notes

1. The PageBackground component creates a softly-blurred, gently-moving gradient background that appears on every page
2. It includes theme-aware opacity adjustments (30% opacity in dark mode, 60% in light mode)
3. The component uses Next.js Image component for optimized loading
4. Includes a backdrop blur effect and subtle grid pattern overlay for enhanced visual appeal
5. Respects user's reduced motion preferences

## Impact
All pages in the application now consistently display the light-background.png image as a blurred background, providing a cohesive visual experience throughout the site.
