# Changelog: TypeScript and Linting Fixes

## Date: 2025-01-06

## Summary
Fixed TypeScript type checking errors and critical linting issues to ensure code quality and build stability.

## Changes Made

### 1. Fixed About Page Structure
- **File**: `app/about/page.tsx`
- **Issues Fixed**:
  - Added missing `<PageBackground />` component to main return statement
  - Fixed mismatched opening and closing tags (changed `</motion.div>` to `</div>`)
  - Added missing closing fragment tag `</>` in reduced motion return
  - Properly wrapped components in React fragments

### 2. Removed Duplicate Icon Entry
- **File**: `components/icons.tsx`
- **Issue**: Duplicate `sparkles` property in ICON_MAP object
- **Fix**: Removed the duplicate entry from line 211, keeping the one on line 181

### 3. Fixed React Unescaped Entities
- **File**: `components/resume-content.tsx`
- **Changes**:
  - Replaced straight quotes with `&quot;` for "version control for reasoning"
  - Replaced apostrophes with `&apos;` in 'AI DIY' and Vercel's
  - Ensures proper HTML entity encoding

## Technical Details

1. **TypeScript Errors**:
   - TS1381: Unexpected token - fixed by proper JSX structure
   - TS17002: Expected corresponding JSX closing tag - resolved with fragments
   - TS1005: '}' expected - fixed by proper component structure
   - TS1117: Duplicate object property - removed duplicate icon entry

2. **ESLint Warnings**:
   - react/no-unescaped-entities - fixed by using HTML entities
   - Additional warnings remain for @ts-ignore and any types in UI components

## Verification
- `pnpm run typecheck` now passes with no errors
- Critical linting issues resolved
- Build process should complete successfully

## Remaining Non-Critical Issues
- Some UI components still use @ts-ignore instead of @ts-expect-error
- Chart component uses `any` types (from third-party library)
- These can be addressed in future updates without affecting functionality
