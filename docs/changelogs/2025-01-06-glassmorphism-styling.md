- **Details**: `bg-white/[0.02] dark:bg-black/[0.02] backdrop-blur-sm`

## Technical Notes

1. **Glassmorphism Effect**: The styling creates a frosted glass appearance with:
   - Semi-transparent backgrounds
   - Backdrop blur effects
   - Subtle borders with transparency
   - Enhanced shadows for depth

2. **Dark Mode Improvements**:
   - Increased text contrast by adjusting foreground colors
   - Improved muted text visibility
   - Better border visibility in dark mode
   - Enhanced icon rendering in dark mode

3. **Performance Considerations**:
   - Backdrop filters are GPU-accelerated in modern browsers
   - The effect degrades gracefully in older browsers
   - Minimal performance impact on modern devices

4. **Calendar Component**: Automatically inherits glassmorphism through the Card component wrapper

## Visual Impact
- Creates a modern, sophisticated look with depth and transparency
- Improves readability in dark mode with better contrast ratios
- Provides visual hierarchy through layered glass effects
- Maintains consistency across all major UI components
