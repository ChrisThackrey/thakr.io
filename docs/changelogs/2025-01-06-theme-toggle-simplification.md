# Changelog: Theme Toggle Simplification

## Date: 2025-01-06

## Summary
Simplified the theme toggle button in the header to directly switch between dark and light modes, removing the dropdown menu and system option for a cleaner, more straightforward user experience.

## Changes Made

### 1. Removed Dropdown Menu
- **File**: `components/theme-toggle.tsx`
- **Changes**:
  - Removed DropdownMenu, DropdownMenuContent, DropdownMenuItem, and DropdownMenuTrigger imports
  - Removed Laptop icon import (used for system option)
  - Eliminated all dropdown-related JSX

### 2. Implemented Direct Toggle
- **File**: `components/theme-toggle.tsx`
- **Implementation**:
  - Added `toggleTheme` function that switches between "dark" and "light" only
  - Button now directly calls `toggleTheme` on click
  - No intermediate menu or system option

### 3. Added Hydration Safety
- **Details**:
  - Added `mounted` state to prevent hydration mismatches
  - Component returns null until mounted on client side
  - Ensures theme state is properly synchronized

## Technical Implementation

\`\`\`typescript
const toggleTheme = () => {
  setTheme(theme === "dark" ? "light" : "dark")
}
\`\`\`

- Direct toggle between two states only
- No system theme detection or fallback
- Clean, predictable behavior

## User Experience Improvements

1. **Simpler Interaction**: Single click to toggle themes
2. **Faster Access**: No dropdown to navigate
3. **Clearer Intent**: Button always switches to the opposite theme
4. **Visual Feedback**: Smooth icon transition between sun and moon

## Configuration
- ThemeProvider already configured with `enableSystem={false}`
- Default theme set to "light"
- Only "light" and "dark" themes are available

## Impact
- Reduced complexity in theme switching
- Improved accessibility with direct action
- Consistent theme behavior across all devices
- No dependency on system preferences
